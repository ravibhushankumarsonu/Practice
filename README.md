# Practice
All of my practice works are here.
### Important Points:-
1. This repo for the all the work done as the practice and as learning perpose. This doesn't include the competative coding.
2. FileStructure of the code are as poper format as `language>Technology>projectName`
  *  For the general practice there is a genral section for that as the `technology` part of the code.
  *  Each project should contain a folder name document irrespective of the languages used. That describe the motive and    planed    structure of that project.
3. Each language should have own running branch for local work that is merge to master after a certain periods to make the structure of the repo managable.
